			<h2>Goal</h2>
				
			<p>We want to leverage the current interest in live programming by bringing together researchers and practitioners to collaborate and learn from each other.</p>
				
			<p>The term "live programming" is a recent catchphrase for programming systems that abandon the traditional edit-compile- run cycle in favor of an instantaneous user experience with live feedback on a program's runtime behavior. Live programming is a quickly-developing topic being defined by practitioners and researchers with diverse backgrounds and interests. It received broad interest among professional software developers and software engineering researchers in the past year.</p>
				
			<p>The goal of this workshop is to focus on exploring notions and degrees of live programming as they relate to software development, creative activities, learning, and performance. We are interested in techniques, tools, demos, infrastructures, languages design insights, and questions that stimulate interest and understanding in live programming concepts.</p>
				
			<h2>topics</h2>

			<p>The workshop will be in the format of an unconference, with topics decided by the interests of the attendees. Below are examples of some, but by far not all (as organizers we do not want to limit the scope of the workshop with our own notion of live programming!) questions that we hope to discuss in the duration of the workshop.</p>

			<p>We encourage position papers, tool demonstrations, and live coding performances that raise excitement and bring insight to these and other questions.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>What are the defining features of live programming and live coding environments?
				<li>How can existing programming systems become more interactive?
				<li>How do live programming environments help or hinder learning?
				<li>What are historical precedents for live programming? Why did they succeed/fail?
				<li>How does live programming augment/replace existing development tools/workflows?
				<li>What are appropriate tool visualizations and affordances?
				<li>What developer activities and programming paradigms benefit most from live programming?
				<li>What language features help or hinder live programming?
				<li>How do existing technologies fit on the spectrum of liveness?
				<li>How to apply live programming in non-audio-visual, possibly industrial domains?			
			</ol>
			
			<h2>submission_guidelines</h2>

			<p>We solicit two kinds of submissions<p>

			<ul>
				<li>Closed-Access Submissions: Research papers (4 pages) that present novel research ideas and early results; and position papers (2 pages) that raise open issues with the potential to stimulate discussion at the workshop. Papers are peer-reviewed by the program committee and will be published behind the paywall of ICSE's academic publisher. If you are a scholar looking for a traditional publication, this is your submission format.</li>
				<li>Open-Access Submissions: Tool demonstrations and performances that present exciting live programming systems and bring insight into the questions addressed by the workshop. Submissions are curated by the program committee, will be published on the workshop's website and archived on Github. If you are a practitioner (or a scholar looking for an open-access publication), this is your submission format.</li>
			</ul>		
				
			<p>Submission guidelines for both formats are<p>

			<ul>	
				<li>Be electronic: Submit your research paper or tool demonstration as PDF document, using the workshop's easychair website. Research papers must follow the ICSE formatting guidelines, tool demonstrations and performances should refer to a downloadable tool or video.
				<li>Be short: Please keep all submissions under 4 pages.
				<li>Be innovative: It is okay to propose a recent idea that still has some unfinished sides to it. This is supposed to be a workshop, not a mini-conference.
				<li>Be a rebel: Neglect these guidelines if you feel that your idea needs a special treatment in some way.
			</ul>
