The submission deadline is XXX.\r\nThe workshop will be held on May XX, co-located with ICSE 2013 in San Francisco, USA.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is live programming?\r\n\r\nLive programming is a recent catchphrase for programming systems that change the traditional, synchronous edit/compile/run conversation of programming into an asynchronous conversation with instantaneous, intuitive, and often visual feedback. \r\n\r\nIn the past year, the concept of _live programming_ has captured the imagination of professional software developers and software engineering researchers. Bret Victor's February talk [\"Inventing on Principle\"](http://vimeo.com/36579366), which features compelling demonstrations of live programming concepts, has spurred widespread interest, discussions, and followup experiments. Since then, new projects such as [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com/), [Circa](http://circa-lang.org/), and others have explored various dimensions of liveness in programming languages and environments. Meanwhile, in the past few years a [community](http://toplap.org/) has formed around the related idea of _live coding_---live audiovisual performances which use computers and algorithms as ephemerally constructed instruments. In contrast to the reflective, persistent nature of live programming precursors like Smalltalk, live coding emphasizes the ephemeral, reactive nature of live performance.\r\n\r\n## Topics\r\n\r\nThe topics below are examples, not bounds. We hope to form a research agenda by bringing people with diverse viewpoints and backgrounds together. So, we prefer fresh, formative, exciting, cutting-edge submissions of ongoing work to summative, cut-and-dried, finished academic works.\r\n\r\n* How does live programming augment or replace existing development tools/workflows?\r\n* What are the appropriate tool visualizations and affordances?\r\n* What are actual (vs perceived) benefits for development?\r\n* What tasks and programming paradigms is it suited for?\r\n* How can it be implemented in real systems?\r\n* What language features help or hinder live programming?\r\n* What are the degrees of ``liveness''?\r\n* How do existing technologies fit on the spectrum of liveness?\r\n* What semantic issues are there?\r\n* What are the parallels with the shift from CLI to GUI interfaces?\r\n\r\n## Submissions\r\n\r\nWe solicit two kinds of submissions: live demos, and short talks with accompanying position papers. Submissions that receive the greatest number of recommendations by the program committee will be allocated 10 minutes during a morning session. All accepted submissions will have an accompanying public blog post. Authors also have the option to include their accepted submission in the workshop's official proceedings.\r\n\r\nTODO: easychair link\r\nTODO: guidance on submitting demos\r\nTODO: formatting, etc guidelines\r\n\r\n## Schedule and Program\r\n\r\n* Morning: talks and demos (TBD)\r\n* Afternoon: unconference\r\n\r\n## Program Committee\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n"}
